# Fair-Grading-Final-Project
In the realm of educational assessment, fairness in grading has been a longstanding challenge. High reliability of assessment can be achieved if each paper is graded by many instructors. Instead of this impractical approach, we attempt to predict many instructors' grades from those of few instructors, by utilizing -statistical inference methods-, looking at a certain amount of inter-rater relations. We employed both synthetic and real-world datasets, constructed our methods in a simulation and cemented our method on an English proficiency exam dataset. We developed three prediction models: a baseline method, a pairwise method and a cumulative method.
